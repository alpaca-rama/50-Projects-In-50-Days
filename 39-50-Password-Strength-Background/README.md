## 39-50-Password-Strength-Background
This project test the password strength by looking at the length.

As the password length grows the background image becomes less blurred and eventually will have no blur.

The project was built with HTML that included some [Tailwind (v1.8.11)](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tailwindcss/1.8.11/tailwind.min.css) (very old) which was included the `head`, CSS and JS.
