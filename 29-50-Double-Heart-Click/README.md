## 29-50-Double-Click-Heeart
A project that does the feature that instagram does (and probably others) whereby you double click and a heart appears.

The heart grows and dissapears on the location of being clicked, afterwhich it is removed from the DOM.

The double click feature was built in two ways. One built with the defaults double click and the other simulating a double click between the time of two individual clicks.

This project was built with HTML (FontAwesome included), CSS and JS.
